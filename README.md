This library allows to use publish-subscribe-style communication model between various components in applications built on a top of Spring framework. It eases decoupling by allowing objects to interact without having direct dependencies upon one another and without requiring event sources to maintain handlers list. It alleviates the pain of explicit listeners registration, proposing easy to use annotation-based configuration instead.
